# Data-Grapher-Using-a-HashMap produces the history of frequencies of an individual name in O(1) runtime (where n is the total number of names).
Each query produces a graph (using DUDraw) that shows the frequency history over time of the entered name. The graphs produced give the first year that the name appeared, the maximum frequency of the name, and the year when the name was most popular.
